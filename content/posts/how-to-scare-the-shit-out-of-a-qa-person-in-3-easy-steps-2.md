Google Chrome (and now also Firefox 4) have the useless little feature of allowing the user to resize any <TEXTAREA> on a page.  
I've found the perfect use case for it:  
  
1\. Go to a page in your website that contains a <TEXTAREA>, like [my Delver profile page](http://www.delver.com/people/pasha-bitz/25?invite=friends-and-family):  
  
  
![](/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/delver-profile.jpg)  
  
  
  
  
2\. Drag the corner of the <TEXTAREA> until reaching a particularly obnoxious appearance:

3\. Now make a screenshot and send an email to your favorite QA person.  
This is the part where you should really get creative. Here's my suggested format:  
  
Subject:  

OMG crazy UI bug in profile page - ON PROD!!

  
Body:  

Hi \[QA person name\],  
Check this out (found on my profile page in PROD).  
  
I can't \*believe\* we missed this and let it reach production this way. Please handle ASAP. Bug should be assigned as "critical"!  
  
thanks,  
\[Your name here\]

  
  
  
You should also CC the QA team manager on this.  
Enjoy.
