**Before:** Best movie ever on IMDB??  
**Plot**: Dark as Batman should be.  
**Acting**: Michael Cane, Garry Oldman and Morgan Freeman - spot on, as always. Heath Ledger - bloody good.  
**The girl**: Maggie Gyllenhaal - WTF?? Suffice to say, I'd almost prefer to have her brother Jake make out with the Joker, Brokeback-Mountain-style, then her. Only good thing is she **Spoiler** (rhymes with "cries").  
**The action**: Yes!  
**The bad guy**: Oh yes!  
**Annoying**: Look, visitors at the Cinema City: do not laugh as morons when the Joker tells a joke. This is not Die Hard. He's a \*sad\* clown.  
**Bottom line**: Better than Godfather? No. But motherfucking good.
