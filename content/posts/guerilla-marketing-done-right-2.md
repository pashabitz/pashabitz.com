If you're opening a new restaurant and want to spread the word but don't have a big marketing budget - what do you do?  
When I got back home tonight, I found this envelope in my mailbox:

It is a **hand written** envelope reading:  

> _Some neighbors steal your paper and some invite you to lunch_  

Now, it's not a printed envelope using a handwriting-like font, it's an actual **hand written** message. An image recognition algorithm would have a hard time but we humans can't mistake the texture of an actual pen on paper. And it has a little heart.  
Of course, I was immediately intrigued.  
  
Inside the envelope was this printed card:

It's an invite for a 50NIS lunch for two at **Carpaccio Bar** on Even Gvirol 8, which I am assuming is a new place.  
Granted, it's printed, but it also has a hand written signature reading  

> _Love, Moran and Eyal  
> _

  
I don't know if the food is any good and I am probably going to lose the card anyway, but I guarantee you I will go check this place out.  
  
Adding just a little bit of **real** personal touch to a marketing campaign does a great job reaching people. Out of the tens of restaurant junk mail that lands in my mailbox every week - this one I actually worked. And it didn't cost anything extra (save for a really long afternoon signing those...)
