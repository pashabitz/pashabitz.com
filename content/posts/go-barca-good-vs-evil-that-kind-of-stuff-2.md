I've been telling everyone who's willing to hear for a while now, that I'm sure that despite all the [latest hype](http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/dec19m.html), Barca will not win the Champions League this year, that they'll lose to either Chelsea or Liverpool, and that one of the last two will win it all eventually, probably Liverpool.

The first reason is that I had a strong gut feeling about it.

But like they say [where I work](http://www.iaf.org.il/Templates/HomePage/HomePage.aspx?lang=EN), "'Gut Feeling' is a name of a fish, and they eat that too". Or something.

The real ultimate and undisputable reason is that Liverpool (and to a lesser extent Chelsea) stand for everything **evil** in football and Barca stand for everything **good**. The former play a negative, joyless kind. The latter play the kind of football that makes you love the game in the first place.

Where's the reason, you ask? Simple. Evil always prevails. And more than that, nothing I want ever happens in football. Never.

So anyway, yesterday I watched the Barca-Celta game and I'm officially changing my tune.

I say Barca will win the Champions League this year. There's just no other way.

I got this thought when I noticed how much the players, Ronaldinho mainly, are watching themselves during the game. They realize perfectly well how great they've been playing lately. And they know how everything can just crumble down in the knock-out stage. So they don't want to get injured. They won the Liga last year, and they can have it won easily this year, it's just not enough this time.

I'll be rooting for Barca [come February](http://www.uefa.com/competitions/UCL/FixturesResults/round=2202/index.html).

And if they lose, well, they might as well cancel that whole football thing. It's just not working.

Effie Arditti corrects:

"...So now lets take a look at some statistic facts:  
Chelsea FC â€“ 19 matches in the league till now, with aggregation of 41-9 in goals...  
Please tell me, is there any other word accept excellence to describe it ?  
This is evil ?? this is a negative football ? ..."

Indeed, that is correct. I guess I'm just overwhelmed by excitement watching Barca lately, so I 'm being emotional. That's all there's to it I guess. Emotions. Football is pretty cool that way.

Liverpool still suck though.
