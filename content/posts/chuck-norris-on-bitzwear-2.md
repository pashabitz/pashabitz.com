Just found a cool feature on [CafePress](http://www.cafepress.com): you can place your Google Analytics tracking code on your CafePress store. Sweet.  
Found under "Your Account -> Manage Shop -> Update Tracking Information".  
  
Also, new design - [Chuck Norris shirts](http://www.cafepress.com/bitzwear/5830870) on Bitzwear.  
  
**Update:** this wasn't clear enough - before typing in the tracking code in CafePress you should create a website profile for your shop, using the "Add Website Profile" in [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics) and typing in the shop's URL (e.g. www.cafepress.com/your\_shop). Then paste in CafePress the code generated by Google Analytics.
