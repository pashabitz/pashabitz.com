Some things I learned about software while watching Die Hard 4.0 and Transformers:  
  
1\. A hacker is most of the times a hot chick.  
2\. A hacker never uses normal operating systems. They have a bizzare OS, that is specifically optimized for their single need - displaying a map of USA with red dots on it.  
3\. When a computer is hacked into, the screen flickers.  
4\. Evil hackers, even if hot chicks, will always be proficient at martial arts as well.  
5\. You can hack a computer system by directing weird sounds at it.  
6\. Visualization is king - code breaking and pattern recognition are achieved using quick manipulations of 3D images.
