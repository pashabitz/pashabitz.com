Got a lot done today:  
Domain - check.  
Server up and running - check.  
First Facebook app created and running on server - check.  
FB API calls working - check.  
MySQL running on the server - check.  
App connects to DB - check.  
  
Bunch of new technology. Feels good to open VS after a long break.
