A few quick updates:  
My company, Semingo, changed its name and from now on we're called **Delver**.  
  
We'll be officially launching our product at the [DEMO conference](http://www.demo.com/conferences/demo08/index.php) in Palm Desert, CA next week (January 28-30).  
If you're there, make sure to drop by our booth (say Pasha sent you), and don't miss the demo. I promise we're one of the coolest products there.  
If you want to be notified when our beta is open, sign up at [delver.com](http://www.delver.com).
