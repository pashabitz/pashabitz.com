There is a very common thing that companies in general—but especially tech companies and startups—do: they pretend or insinuate that the company is more than just a for-profit organization. Instead, they frame things as a friendship or a family. Because of that, individual employees are expected to do things they would normally only do for friends or family—things that are sometimes not strictly in the best interest of the employee.

Let me give you some examples and explain why I think this is misleading and disingenuous.

The first example is about loyalty. It’s often expected that if an employee decides to leave, whether it's because they receive a much better offer (compensation or otherwise), they should not take it. Instead, they are expected to stay out of loyalty.

Another example is the supposed existence of a certain etiquette. After accepting an offer, a future employee is expected not to back out—even if something changes and they no longer want to join.

I’ve listened to senior, experienced team members lament how "unprofessional" it is for someone to do this. They often cite youth or inexperience and chastise the individual, teaching others how unacceptable it is, how "it’s a small Valley," and that this sort of behavior is just not done.

This is a bunch of baloney. Here's why:

A company will always  do whatever is best for the company:

I have sat through countless conversations where an employee was being let go because that was right for the company, no matter how terrible it was for the individual.

I've read of job offers being rescinded on the employee's first day (!) because that’s what suits the company, regardless of what it means for the individual.

Don't get me wrong: the company has every right (and also duty) to do so, and I don't think the people responsible are happy to make these decisions or cause harm.

What’s striking to me is the intellectual dishonesty required to preach about what is “proper” to do as an employee when it’s absolutely clear any company will do whatever suits it best, disregarding the individual, if interests don’t align.

This doesn't mean there aren’t great company leaders (I was fortunate to work with some) who genuinely care about their employees and try to do right by them.

But here's the rub: this only lasts as long as it doesn’t contradict the needs of the company.

So my advice to anyone starting out is: when interacting with an employer, do exactly what is best for you. Don’t be a jerk. But if you want to leave your job—go for it. If the offer you accepted isn’t right for you—apologize, but do what’s right for you.

Yes, it's a small valley. Yes, all else being equal you should always the right thing by the people you interact with. Of course, your word is something to value and protect.

But don’t forget: if the tables turn, the company will always—100% of the time—do what’s right for itself, regardless of the implications for you.
