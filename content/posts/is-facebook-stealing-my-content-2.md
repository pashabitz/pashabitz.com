Soon after publishing my last post ["Google's Starfish"](http://www.pashabitz.com/2009/12/16/Googles+Starfish.aspx) here, I was very (unpleasantly) surprised to discover the **whole post** appear as a "note" on my Facebook page. I wouldn't have even noticed that, unless someone post a comment on that post, **inside Facebook**.  
In the past, I did, on my own will, configure the RSS of pashabitz.com to appear on my Facebook.  
But still, my natural reaction was to get extremely pissed, even though no explicit rule was probably broken here by Facebook. I've been trying to figure out why I got so mad. Here's what I came up with:  
  
**Change of the rules**  
Facebook changed the behavior in a non-trivial way without asking me first. Commonly, other sites only syndicate a **small part** of the external content and point back to the original. This is what Facebook did in the past too.  
They still have a link to the "original post", but it is very non prominent.  
  
**Stealing content...**  
The whole text of my post on this blog appears as a standard Facebook entity (the "note") virtually exactly **as if it was published on Facebook itself**. There is absolutely zero motivation and additional value for the reader to click-through to my own site, where I actually posted the content. Also remember that Google doesn't like seeing the exact same content on two different URLs.  
  
**...and making money off that content**  
Guess what - Facebook display an ad on the "note" page which is a copy of my blog post. They get the money for showing that ad.  
  
  
What do you think?
