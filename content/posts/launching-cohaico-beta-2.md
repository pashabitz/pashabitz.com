A little less than three months ago I started working on my new project, [Cohaico](http://cohai.co), and today I'm launching the public beta of the website. From the [announcement post on the Cohaico blog](http://blog.cohai.co/launching-cohaico-beta):

> Let us fix that for you.
> 
> Guess what - your friends are already sharing everything they know about stuff. They do it on social networks like Twitter.
> 
> But if you get on Twitter - you'll just see what was said in the last few hours or so. It's hard to see what all your friends said about a particular thing.
> 
> This is what Cohaico does.

Exciting times!
