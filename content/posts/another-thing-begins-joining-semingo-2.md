As [I've mentioned](http://www.pashabitz.com/PermaLink,guid,8a56cdf3-8531-405e-899a-11b3271289fa.aspx), I left Clarizen a couple of months ago.  
Now about the new thing:  
I joined a new startup company - Semingo.  
During the past year I got certain that what I want to do right now is develop ideas "from scratch" in a startup environment. So when Sagie, who is one of the founders of Semingo and my friend from the army days invited me to join - it was a perfect fit.  
The idea we're working on is very exciting and the people on the team are very bright.  
[Oren](http://www.lnbogen.com/) and [Tomer](http://www.tomergabel.com/) are also blogging from a few feet away (and more bloggers coming soon!!).  
We've only just started but it's been a lot of fun already.  
About the product: all I can say right now is that it's related to social networks (just because that's what the [press release says](http://www.carmelventures.com/c_newsitem.asp?id=447)) and it's as cool as ice (before global warming). Don't worry, we're planning to release soon, so you'll be able to use it in no time (touch wood) - stay tuned!
