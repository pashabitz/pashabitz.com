Last night was Super Bowl 43. Alas, I am in a timezone that doesn't allow me to even care. But I love a good movie trailer, and a big bunch of them was released during the commercial breaks last night.

So here are four of them, in a biased order of ascending coolness:

1\. G.I. Joe:  
  

  
  
2\. [Terminator Salvation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmdJgP8Ld6o)(sorry, no embed available)

  
3\. Star Trek:  
  

  
  

4\. [Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen](http://www.transformersmovie.com/)(better quality here than in YouTube)
