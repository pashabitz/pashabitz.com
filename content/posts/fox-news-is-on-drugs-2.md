So, this guy Glenn Beck is live on Fox, interviewing this guy Robert Gellately, author of [Lenin, Stalin and Hitler](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400040051?ie=UTF8&tag=bitzblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1400040051).  
Glenn Beck: So, when Lenin came to power through the 1917 revolution, he had all the heads of factories and businessmen killed, right?  
Robert Gelatelly: Right.  
GB: And, this is sort of like what president Obama is doing to the AIG execs now, right?  
RG: Right.  
And it goes on.  
  
A little crazy in the head, aren't we?
