Yesterday I met with Omer Perchik who told me about his new startup [Any.Do](http://any.do/).  
Honesty, I amazed with what he and his partner are doing. I am usually a critical person and I dismiss ideas very easily but I have to take my hat off for these guys. What is awesome about it is the **combination** of:  

*   Great product idea
*   How smooth execution looks  
    
*   Super solid business model
*   How crystal clear the vision is

Mark my words: Any.Do is going to be the best new product of 2011.  
They're looking, so if you are a developer based in Israel - I very strongly suggest you [apply for a job right now](http://anydosite.appspot.com/wanted).
