[Zoominfo](http://www.zoominfo.com/) is a website that exposes a database of companies and people. Zoominfo builds this database automatically by software that crawls the web and extracts structured data from unstructured web pages (for example, "about" pages in company websites and press releases) using natural language processing algorithms.  
A while ago, I posted a [little satirical "press release"](http://www.pashabitz.com/PermaLink,guid,459535d4-379d-4564-8117-5699f10d9e19.aspx) about me, the CTO of pashabitz.com, purchasing a burekas from "sammy burekas".  
A couple of weeks ago zoominfo's crawler reached that "press release" and now [I am listed](http://www.zoominfo.com/Search/PersonDetail.aspx?PersonID=1179825729&QueryID=9c85ce7b-1520-441f-9e3c-86e15d775574) as the "chief technology officer of pashabitz.com".  
  
Just a reminder of how hard it is to code anything related to AI.  
Computers just can't get a joke.
