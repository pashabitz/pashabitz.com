Turns out I was born in the Year of the Rooster(1981).

Here's what the [chinese calendar site](http://www.new-year.co.uk/chinese/calendar.htm) has to say:

_"The sign of the Rooster indicates a person who is hard-working and definite about their decisions. Roosters are not afraid to speak their minds and can therefore sometimes come across as boastful. They make good restaurant owners and world travellers."_

I definitely agree withÂ "definite about their decisions" and "sometimes come across as boastful".

And that stuff about "good world travellers" - Amen to that. Is that a job? "World Traveller". I can do that.

Well, go over there, see what it says about you.

p.s.

2005 is a Year of the Rooster too, so naturally I expect a fatter-than-usual cheque. So start saving now.
