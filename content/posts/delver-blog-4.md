> _In addition to chatting with your friend, you can share your browsing with them by clicking the “start sharing” link at the bottom of the chat room. This means that your friend will see what products, catalogs and profiles you’re browsing on Delver. You can use this to show your friends things you like and talk about them at the same time. It’s like going shopping together._
