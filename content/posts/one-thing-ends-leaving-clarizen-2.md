I should've posted on this a while ago, but it's been crazy lately. Better late than never.  
A month ago I left my place of work at [Clarizen](http://www.clarizen.com). It's not been long, but it was definitely a great time for me.  
I learned a lot and had so much fun.  
Most importantly, I had a chance to work with some very talented and wonderful people - [Eyal](http://www.epocalipse.com/blog/), Eli, [Dudu](http://notsosmartbuilder.blogspot.com/), Sasha, Asher and many many more.  
I participated in the development since a relatively early stage in the product's life and seen the release of the public beta.  
Do take a look at what came out in the end - [www.clarizen.com](http://www.clarizen.com).  
  
**p.s.** Clarizen-friends: don't forget to buy me a beer when the IPO comes!!!
