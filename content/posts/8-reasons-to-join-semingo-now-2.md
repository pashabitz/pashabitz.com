1\. Work on something really big. I mean so big, it's a hubris to even think about it.  
2\. Our product is related to social networks, so if your boss catches you staring at good-looking girls (or boys) in Facebook, you can say "It's for work" and he will beleive it.  
3\. Pool table at work. (May be taken away from us any day now, so hurry up!!)  
4\. Work with really smart people. But not annoying, self important, square-type smart. Smart and fun-to-get-drunk-with type.  
5\. Our offices are ideally situated on the 10th floor in the Hertzlya-Pituach hi-tech district.  
Perfect for [BASE jumping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASE_jumping), if you can squeeze out. The windows don't open that much.  
View of the sea (if CEO).  
6\. Solve really complicated problems on a daily basis, such as: How to effectively store and access a graph that is many terabytes in size? How to extract meaning from unstructured text? Where to go for lunch??  
7\. Cutting edge technology and methods: .Net, Java, WCF, JLO, search engines, MySQL, TFS, Scrum, just to mention a few.  
You know JLO is a fake one, right?  
8\. Free [Bitzwear t-shirt](http://www.bitzwear.com) as signing bonus.
