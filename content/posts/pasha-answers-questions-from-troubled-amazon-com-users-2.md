Amazon now has a "Customer Discussions (beta)" section on the product page.  
Here's a snapshot of something I stumbled upon just now:

Lets try to help the lost souls, shall we:  
**Q: I'm a lesbian but I believe in God what should I do?**  
Don't tell Him.  
And don't tell your girlfriend.  
**Q: How many sins did you commit today?**  
Who, me? about six or seven. Wait, last night was already today too? Hmm. Maybe like ten. I didn't know she was married, man.  
**Q: Why are there so many Atheists on a Religion forum?**  
We like it here. It's quiet and sunny. The girls are cute.  
But enough with us, why are You Capitalizing Any Word That Has To Do With religion, yo??  
**Q: Only religion leads us to Truth!**  
Oh, I see now. Good answer.  
**Q: What is the meaning of a "pure heart" especially in today's society?**  
"She told him she only likes him for the car".  
And Google [doesn't know either](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&rlz=1T4ADBR_enIL232IL232&q=define%3A%22pure+heart%22) so that's the best you're going to get.  
**Q: Is George Bush the Anti-Christ?**  
Anti-Christ? I thought he was just "anti exis of evil". Is Christ there too? Is he with that North Korean dude with the expensive booze?
