This is so cool. I just bought the new Radiohead album, "In Rainbows".  
What's so special? The album is available only by direct download from a website set up by the band ([http://www.inrainbows.com/](http://www.inrainbows.com/)).  
Everybody wins:  
1\. The buyer - finally, I can legally download music from the internet (iTunes and the like do not allow downloads with a credit card that is issued in Israel).  
2\. The seller - Radiohead bypass the record label, and probably profit more for each album sold.  
  
But that's not all. Coolness factor number 2 - you get to set the price you pay for the album. That's right. This is a brilliant idea already emplyed in the past ([read here](http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/05/03/how-is-a-canadian-art-pop-singer-like-a-bagel-salesman/)). When you trust your customers, they return the favor. Turns out, people end up paying **more on average** when given the chance to set the price themselves.  
This is a very interesting pricing model that I think can work out very well for various products (perhaps web applications too). This method probably suits best products where the "normal" price is lower than a certain limit (say 100$). Above that I'm not sure it will work.  
  
As to bypassing record labels and selling music direct over the web - I think in 2 years 90% of the artists will go this way.  
  
p.s.  
I payed 6 GBP, which is about 12 USD or 50 NIS.
