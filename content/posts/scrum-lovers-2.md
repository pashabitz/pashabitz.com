There is a strange, underground, free-mason, rappers-delight, a-tribe-called-quest, thank-you-chuck-norris, scrum-lover-association-kind-of-thing taking shape as we speak.  
For some reason, [Moti](http://blog.karmona.com/index.php/2007/10/09/scrum-clan/) and [Oren](http://www.lnbogen.com/ScrumClan.aspx) simultaneously posted some seriously weird posts with some scrum mambo jambo in them. Moti even added some scary Egyptian-writing-stlye codewords in the end.  
  
And then, of all things, they tagged me to be a "scrum clan member".  
Well well. And I thought **this** blog doesn't take itself seriously.  
If this is some sort of scheme to make me write something I don't stand behind, well, you got another thing coming, boys. My opinions on the Agile Methodologies are well defined and will be expressed in written form sooner rather than later.  
And I'm supposed to tag someone.  
  
Goodie goodie, it's a game.  
  
For my serious pick, I tag [Shani](http://www.human-debugger.net/), who is doing really cool agile stuff as a team lead.  
For my less serious, I-can-post-weirder-than-you-can pick, I tag [Tomer](http://www.tomergabel.com/) as "scrum lover undercover".  
  
p.s.  
Does "tagging" mean I'm supposed to actually post something on scrum? Is that it?  
  
p.p.s.
